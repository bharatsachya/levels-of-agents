## Stock Predictino app

### Setup and Installation

To run this application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project uses `yfinance` to fetch stock data, so ensure it's properly installed.

### Features

-   **Stock Prediction:** Utilizes CNN and LSTM models for stock price prediction.
-   **CNN Model Enhancements:** (Optional - add more details here if the changes in `wise_cnn.py` introduce user-perceptible new features or significant improvements. If not, this can be omitted for now, assuming it's an internal bug fix/refinement).
